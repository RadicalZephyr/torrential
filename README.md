# Torrential

Torrential is a simple BitTorrent client written in Clojure.

## Installation

You need at least Java 7 to run Torrential, but since that is
[no longer supported][java-eol] by Oracle we recommend using
[Java 8][java8].

[java-eol]: https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml
[java8]: http://java.com/en/download/

Once you have java, you can simply
[download the latest jar][torrential].

## Usage

Basic running from the command line:

    $ java -jar torrential-0.1.0-standalone.jar

Eventually, will probably also package a `.exe` for Windows. Maybe
even a native Mac App, who knows!

### Bugs

Currently, there are no bugs, because there is no code!

But when they do start occurring, you can
[see what bugs we know about][issues] and
[report new ones][file-issue] on Github.
